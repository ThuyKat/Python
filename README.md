- Hurricane Analysis - Python dict practice
- Basic Understanding of OOP concepts: instant variables, class variable, constructors
- Question 1- Leetcode (Easy)- TwoSum: str.index() method practice,  "break" used in a loop to end its operation before the string ends. 
- Question 2 - Leetcode (Medium) - Thelongestsubstring: practice "for" loop . When list appends more elements, loops still keep running, which is different to string- the original string is not modifiable, the loop stops at the end of the string. - how to make to loop continue even after it goes to the end of string/list? option 1: while loop/ option2: while True/ option3: adding counter. 
- Question 3 - Leetcode (Easy)- Valid Parenthesis - use a string started from empty string to check if the original string satisfies the requirment. 
- Question 5 - .count() methods, sort dicts by values in reverse order
- RECURSIVE Notes:
  * Turn big problems into a smaller problems
  * Start the function with base cases
  * Tail recursion optimization: change "if" into "while" loop and change the value of the parameter at the end of function
  * Any iteration problem can be solved by recursion and vice versa. Non-recursive is better in time and space complexity
  * Draw tree graph to ensure the correct operation
